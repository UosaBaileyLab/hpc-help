Backups
=======

In addition to primary storage, the cluster has an additional 2.3 PB of capacity dedicated to storing backups.

.. important::
  Storage is expensive, and syncing backups is time consuming, so please read the :doc:`data-storage` and ensure your data is kept in the appropriate locations.


Retention policies
------------------

New or changed data is synced nightly to our backup servers - ``delorean`` and ``docbrown`` - and then snapshots are taken and kept for as long as the policy for that data dictates.
